          <h3>ABOUT QUANTUM CLINIC</h3>
          <p>
            In 2020 our founders, Dr. Ramos and Dr. Lehman decided to
            double-down on building the infrastructure for your most profound
            transformation and self-healing. Bridging their combined expertise
            across mental health in complex emergencies, treating trauma,
            addiction, and stress, they created an experience unlike anything
            else in Southern California.

      <h3>AT THE QUANTUM CLINIC, YOUR SERENITY IS OUR MISSION</h3>
      <div>
        <p>
          Because we all deserve a place to unplug and tune in. When you are
          empowered with the tools to reverse stress and connect to your inner
          wisdom, everything changes. You become lighter. You show up
          differently for the task at hand. You deepen your compassion for
          yourself and others. You gain clarity on your purpose, and courage
          to fulfill your mission. At the Quantum Clinic we offer you an
          opportunity to reset your baseline. Our services are evidence-based,
          rooted in an understanding of epigenetics and biophysics to promote
          deep cellular resonance and heart-brain coherence. At the Quantum
          Clinic, your serenity is our mission. This is subtle energy work at
          it's finest. Our clinic is conveniently located in Elysian Valley,
          just 10 minutes North of Downtown Los Angeles, California.
